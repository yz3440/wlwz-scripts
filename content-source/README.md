## About the Original Scripts

These scripts were meticulously transcribed from the 26-disc mainland China DVD version and further supplemented with content from the 20-disc Taiwan DVD release (highlighted in red in the original). The scripts focus on dialogue, omitting actor improvisations and most action descriptions to showcase the show's linguistic artistry.

## Contribution Notes

The original transcription was a collaborative effort by numerous fans in 2007. The audited version addresses inconsistencies that naturally arose from having different contributors work on different episodes, creating a more standardized reference text while preserving the content.
